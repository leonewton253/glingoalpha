glingoalpha
===========

Alpha build of Brain training software, forked from brainworkshop.

The goal of Glingo is to help people learn a new language through a sleek HTML5 
interface. The interface will be a community driven platform where users can submit resources such as images and sound bytes to be used by other users. Significant changes need to be made to the source to allow this, and new games need to be made based from the core app. Make it more addictive to play but just as stimulating. 

Goals:
- Port to django or some other kind of web app with HTML5
- Flesh out basic platform functions, such as uploading resources, deleting, renaming, etc. A basic file-system with multiple users and permissions.
- Create a basic module for USB or Bluetooth connectivity for a device through the web app
- Web App is runnable on all Android versions that support chrome
- Configure app for use on google app engine
